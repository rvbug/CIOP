# Cognitive Interaction Optimization Platform - CIOP



# Introduction

CIOP is a multi-domain RL framework designed to optimize human-computer interaction in real time. It is composed of domain-specific agents, each focusing on a unique aspect of efficiency:
- [ ] COWI (Cognitive Optimization Workflow Intelligence) — Adaptive task sequencing.
- [ ] ACON (Autonomous Command Optimization Network) — Reduce cognitive load and execution time.


# Paper
This project is the foundation for the upcoming paper: `**Multi-Domain Cognitive Optimization via Real-Time Reinforcement Learning**`
The research explores:

- Cross-domain RL architecture
- Reward modeling

# Current Status
 
 - [x] Synthetic data generators for simulation
 - [x] Early RL environment prototypes
 - [ ] Real-time event streaming from multiple domains
 - [ ] Policy integration for live adaptation
 - [ ] Multi-domain benchmark tests
